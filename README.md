# Pomodoro Timer
Pomodoro Timer is a web-application for anyone who whishes to follow the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). When you start the timer it assumes you will work in a focused session for the duration of the time. The Timer will alert you when the session is over and it's time for you to take a short break. Again the Timer will alert you when the break is over.
